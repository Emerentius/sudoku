[features]
# The solver does enough indexing that the performance impact can be significant
# ranging from 2-12% of the total runtime spent because of bounds checks.
# Nevertheless, the solver is fast enough with checks that you probably don't want to risk
# being pwned because of a bug in it so checks are activated by default
# This feature deactivates bounds checks in the solver.
